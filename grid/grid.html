      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>Mycelium is a natural fungi material with industrial-level strength that has 
         been explored in recent years as a potential building material. This emerging 
         material could be used as the building blocks (literally) for future homes!
      </p>
      <h3>What is mycelium?</h3>
      <p> The mycelium of fungus refers to the fragile root-like fibers of fungus that 
          live underneath the ground. Mycelium is 100% organic, compostable, and biodegradable. 
          When it is dried, it becomes incredibly durable and resistant to water, mold, and fire.
          To date, mycelium has most often been used for packaging purposes. One company, 
          Ecovative Design, has discovered ways to use mycelium for more than packaging. They 
          are creating alternative meat products, animal-free leather, skincare products, and 
          more. With their fabrication process, they can control the texture, strength, and 
          porosity of mycelium-based products. What sets mycelium apart from other materials 
          is its ability to regenerate at a quick rate. It can also be used for 3-D printing 
          and is non-toxic, insulating, and all-natural. Mycelium has the potential to create a 
          new paradigm for design in the building industry.
